# ACF - Google Fonts Field
A field for Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) allowing users to select fonts from the Google Fonts suite.

This plugin creates a new ACF field that can be used to select fonts from the Google Fonts library using thier [webfonts API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api).

A local copy of API results are included with the plugin, however, an Google Fonts API key is helpful to update the fonts list automatically.
